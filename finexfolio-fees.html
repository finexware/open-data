FEES

3 TYPES OF AUTOMATED FEES
The platform automatically calculates the fees that investors pay. At the end of the billing period all the due fees are automatically transferred to your account from your investors' accounts.

The calculations and the payments aren't affected by the number of your investment proposals, the number of subscribed investors or the terms and conditions.


Subscription fee
A fixed sum paid regularly for the subscription to your investment proposal regardless of the performance of your trading strategy.

Performance fee
A percentage of the profit you generated for your investors. The fee is calculated based on HwM.

Management fee
A percentage of investors' equity paid regardless of the performance of your strategy.


SUBSCRIPTION FEE
A fixed sum per month for the subscription to your investment proposal. Investors pay this fee regardless of your trading strategy's performance.

How it works
The fee is transferred to your account on the first day of every month. However, the billing period starts as soon as you open the first trading position on the investor account. As long as the trading activity hasn't started, the fee isn't charged.

Withdrawal of funds
If investors withdraw all their funds before the end of the billing period, the platform automatically calculates the due fee amount. This amount is calculated based on the number of days within the billing period when investors were subscribed to your investment proposal.

Deposit of funds
If investors deposit additional funds before the end of the billing period, it doesn't affect the amount of due fee.


PERFORMANCE FEE
You receive a percentage of the profit that you generated for investors. The fee is calculated based on high-water mark (HwM). It protects investors in case the trading strategy is unprofitable. The platform automatically re-calculates the HwM upon investors' deposits and withdrawals.

How it works
A fee based on HwM means that the next fee is paid to the asset manager only when the current balance on the investor account is higher than the balance at the moment the last fee was charged.

Withdrawal of funds
If investors withdraw funds, the remaining balance becomes the new HwM.

Deposit of funds
If investors deposit funds, the deposited amount is added to the HwM and the final balance sum becomes the new HwM.


MANAGEMENT FEE
The percentage of the fee is calculated based on the equity on the investor account at the end of the billing period. Investors pay the management fee regardless of the success of the trading strategy at the end of the billing period.

How it works
The billing period for this type of fee is one year. If you set a more frequent periodicity of payments the platform will re-calculate the amount of due fee accordingly.

Withdrawal of funds
If investors partially of fully withdraw funds from the account before the end of the billing period, the platform automatically re-calculates the due amount and transfers it to your account. The new billing period starts after the payment.

Deposit of funds
If investors deposit funds before the end of the billing period, the platform automatically calculates the amount of due fee and transfers it to your account. The new billing period starts after the payment.
