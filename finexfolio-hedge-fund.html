HEDGE FUND

In this business model you trade on a single account that consists of all the funds on the accounts of your investors.

Investors subscribe to your investment proposal on standard terms. Therefore, it’s easy to manage an unlimited number of investors with any deposit amounts: be it $100 or $10 000.

Positions are opened at the same price for everyone. The profits and losses are distributed to investor accounts in proportion to the invested capital with maximum precision till 0.00000001 lot.


MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

You see all the deposit and withdrawal requests in real time. Therefore, you can manually approve them whenever convenient.

Alternatively, you can set a schedule in the calendar. The platform will automatically approve all the pending deposit and withdrawal requests at the time you set.

Deposits and withdrawals won’t affect your trading strategy, no matter if approved manually or automatically.


REALLOCATION AND AUTOCORRECTION SYSTEMS
TO MANAGE OPEN POSITIONS UPON SUBSCRIPTION OR UNSUBSCRIPTION OF INVESTORS
The systems of reallocation and autocorrection make sure that the trading process and risk management rules work smoothly, when someone joins or leaves your hedge fund.

When investors subscribe to or unsubscribe from your investment proposal, the shares of the hedge fund will be reallocated between its members in new proportions based on their amount of capital.

The same happens with the shares in open positions: they will be reallocated in new proportions between the existing and the new members.

Reallocation and autocorrection systems determine the shares allocation rules.


REALLOCATION IS ON
Subscription of investors
When a new investor subscribes to your investment proposal, he’ll get a share in your hedge fund and in all the open positions.

The volume of open positions will remain the same and the accumulated P&L will be recorded on the accounts of existing members of your hedge fund. The shares in open positions will be reallocated between all the members in the same proportions as the reallocated shares in the hedge fund.


Unsubscription of investors
When an investor unsubscribes from your investment proposal, the P&L will be recorded both on his account and on accounts of the remaining members of the hedge fund.

The shares in the hedge fund will be reallocated between the remaining members in new proportions. The shares in the open positions will be reallocated in the same proportions as in the hedge fund.


AUTOCORRECTION IS ON
Subscription of investors
When a new investor subscribes to your investment proposal, he won’t get a share in the already open positions.

However, the shares of the hedge fund will be reallocated between its members in new proportions. When you open a new position, the newly subscribed investor will join it. The shares in this position will be allocated between the members in the same proportions as in the hedge fund.


Unsubscription of investors
When an investor unsubscribes from your investment proposal, all the open positions will be partially closed, i.e. their capital will be decreased by the withdrawn amount.

The shares in the hedge fund will be reallocated between the remaining members in new proportions.


TRADING PORTFOLIO FOR YOUR HEDGE FUND

You can connect several trading strategies to the account of your hedge fund, thus creating a trading portfolio for your hedge fund.

It’s convenient when you work with a team of traders each of which develops their own trading strategy or when you yourself have several strategies.

For every strategy you set up a separate trading account. When you connect a strategy to your hedge fund, you designate a certain share of the hedge fund’s capital to this strategy, set the allocation type and the risk management rules. All the positions will be copied from the strategy’s account to the account of the hedge fund.

You can change the allocation type and the risk management rules any time without interrupting the trading. If the strategy doesn't perform as expected, you can pause it or decrease its share of the designated capital in the hedge fund.


CONVENIENT MANAGEMENT OF YOUR HEDGE FUND'S TRADING PORTFOLIO

No matter how you manage your hedge fund's trading portfolio, it won’t adversely affect the performance of the hedge fund or the accounts of your investors.

You can subscribe the account of your hedge fund to a new trading strategy at any time. When a strategy doesn’t perform properly you can always pause it. If necessary, you can also change the allocation type or the risk management rules.

Whatever you do, it won’t interrupt your trading or you won’t need to re-subscribe your investors to your hedge fund after that.


FLEXIBLE PRICING PLANS FOR INVESTORS WITH DIFFERENT DEPOSITS

Even though your investors subscribe to your investment proposal on standard terms, you can still offer them several pricing plans depending on their minimum deposit.
