<h1>START YOUR OWN <br>ONLINE HEDGE FUND</h1>
<p>FINEXFOLIO is an asset management platform that enables every trader or asset manager to start their own hedge fund. </p>

Quick launch
Your hedge fund will be instantly created online.

No huge investments
You don’t have any infrastructural costs.

On your own terms
Introduce investors to your own brand.

YOUR OWN PLATFORM TO START AN ASSET MANAGEMENT BUSINESS
Purchasing the platform licence you get your own copy of the platform to set up on your domain. You don’t depend on the broker or any other service provider.

The platform automates all the functions of a traditional hedge fund: accounting, reporting, onboarding investors and others. You focus on trading and the platform does the rest.

ALL THE ROUTINE IS AUTOMATED

Fast investor subscription

Investors can subscribe to your investment proposals without even contacting you. The platform will guide them through the subscription process.

Automated fee payment

The platform automatically calculates all the fees and transfers them from investor accounts to your account. Thus, you’ll get guaranteed remuneration.

Transparent reporting

Both you and your investors receive reports about the trading transactions and money transfers. This gives you full control over your accounts.

Risk management system

The platform has two separate risk management systems for you and your investors so that your trading accounts are protected from unplanned losses.

Regulatory compliance
To start your own hedge fund you only need an asset management licence. If you don’t have one, you can get the regulatory cover after the due diligence procedure.

The platform contains templates of legal documents you may need for your asset management business. All of them are approved by lawyers. However, you can modify them based on your needs.

CHOOSE THE SUITABLE BUSINESS MODEL BASED ON YOUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
MANAGED ACCOUNTS
Suitable for managing several individual investor accounts with substantial deposits. It allows you to negotiate individual terms and conditions with every investor.

Hedge fund
Suitable for managing an unlimited number of investors regardless of their deposit amounts. In this business model you work with all your investors on standard terms.

3 types of automated fees
You can charge 3 types of fees for your services: performance, management and subscription fees. Depending on your business model you can combine fees or set different fees for investors with different deposit amounts.

All the fees are calculated and transferred to your account automatically.

INVESTMENT PROPOSALS BASED ON YOUR TRADING HISTORY
As soon as you’ve uploaded your trading history, the platform will automatically generate an investment proposal. The proposals are designed to show the benefits of your trading strategy in the most attractive way and disclose the risks and terms.

IMMEDIATE INVESTOR SUBSCRIPTION
Investors can subscribe to your investment proposals on their own, without contacting you. The platform will guide them during the onboarding process.

All trading operations, the statistical and analytical data are updated on the investor's account in real time, so he'll have full control over it.

Upon the first subscription to your investment proposal, the investor will have to pass a compliance test. It guarantees that the investor is fully aware of the potential risk. If the investor stays, he'll have to pass the test annually.

Two risk management systems
The platform has two separate risk management systems: for you and for your investors. So that you can set the risk limits independently from each other. You set the loss limit for the day, and your investors set profit and loss limits for their whole account.

One one hand, it lets you strictly follow your trading strategy. On the other hand, it lets investors feel secure as they have full control over their funds.

RELIABILITY AND SECURITY
The funds of your investors are kept on their personal brokerage accounts so that nobody except the investor would have access to them. It provides your investors the necessary protection from any possible fraud.

As an asset manager you have the right to execute orders on the accounts of your investors and receive fees for your services. Just like in a traditional hedge fund.

COMFORT AND TRANSPARENCY FOR YOUR INVESTORS in their personal web interface
In the asset management business relationships are based on trust. It’s important to show your investors that their funds are safe with you. FINEXFOLIO platform will help you provide them with the sense of security.
In a user-friendly interface investors can get an overview of their account: account statement, performance reports, trading transactions, analytics, fee payments. They don’t need to use a trading terminal.

Funds kept on investor account

Investors’ funds are kept on their personal brokerage accounts. They can control them in the broker’s trader’s room or directly in the platform’s web interface.

Chat with the asset manager

The platform has an in-built chat so that investors could contact you directly with any questions or issues.

Transparent reporting in real time

Investors can view reports on all the trading activities on their accounts as well as monetary transactions in real time.

Separate risk management system

Investors may set separate profit and loss limits if they would like to take less risk than the investment proposal implies.
