FAQ

How to become an asset manager?
To become an asset manager, get a demo-platform by clicking the "Get demo platform" button.
Submit your data and trading strategy to get the live platform license. We'll check the information you submitted. If everything is fine, your license will appear shortly.
When the license is issued, you'll have to open a brokerage account and connect it to the platform. Thereafter you can publish your investment proposals and let your investors subscribe.

How can an investor subscribe to an investment proposal?
To subscribe to your investment proposal, the investor has to open a brokerage account and register in your platform. After logging in to the platform the investor should click the "Invest" button in the investment proposal of his choice.


What fees can the asset manager receive?
The asset manager can set the fees himself.
Performance fee: up to 50%.
Management fee: up to 5% of AuM (Assets under Management).
Subscription fee: up to 500$.


How to open a brokerage account?
After having got the demo platform, you'll receive two e-mails: from FINEXWARE and from the prime broker of your choice. To work with FINEXFOLIO, you'll have to open an account with that prime broker.
Follow the instructions in the broker's e-mail.


How to deposit or withdraw funds?
You can deposit or withdraw funds in the broker's Trader's Room.


Could the asset manager also be an IB affiliate at the same time?
No, as itâ€™s a conflict of interest. The asset manager can only receive performance, management and subscription fees, while the IB gets his standard remuneration.


Where is the investment capital kept?
All the investors' funds are kept on their personal brokerage accounts. As an asset manager you are entitled to manage these funds but you cannot transfer them between accounts.
