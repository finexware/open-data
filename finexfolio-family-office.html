FAMILY OFFICE

In this business model you trade on your own account while the platform copies your trades to the accounts of your investors in proportion to their capital.

Even though investors subscribe to your investment proposal on standard terms, you can offer individual conditions to each of them: set custom fees and order allocation type or pause trading activities on their account.

As the orders are copied from your account to the investor's account, the opening and closing prices on investor accounts may slightly differ from the opening and closing prices on your account.

COPY ONLY NEW POSITIONS

Flexible subscription terms
for your investors
Depending on your trading strategy
Suitable for day-trading
The platform will copy only new positions, i.e. the ones that you’ll open after the subscription of an investor. It won’t copy the positions opened before the subscription, even if they’re still open.


COPY POSITIONS WITH A BETTER CURRENT PRICE

Suitable for mid-term trading
The platform won’t copy any profitable positions. It’ll copy only those positions, whose current price is lower than the opening price.
Therefore, investors will enter the trade at a better price. Their profit will be higher when you take profit on those positions or their losses will be lower if there happens to be a loss.


COPY ALL POSITIONS

Suitable for long-term trading
The platform will copy all the open positions from your account to the investor account. No matter if there’s currently a profit or a loss.
Therefore, upon the subscription investors buy all the instruments at the current market price in order to build the same portfolio as yours in the long-term.


CONVENIENT MANAGEMENT OF INVESTORS

The information concerning your investors is displayed on a single dashboard. If necessary, you can also access every investor’s information in greater detail.

On the dashboard you see the list of investors, the total AuM, profits, losses, expected fees etc. If you wish to customise the fees or the allocation type for a certain investor, you can do it in their card.


Individual allocation types for every investor
You set the standard allocation type in your investment proposal. If necessary, you can customise it for a certain investor.

Proportionally by balance
If you want the investor account to grow in proportion to the growth of your account.

Proportionally by equity
When calculating the size of the position, the platform uses all the funds on the investor account, including profit and loss.

Proportionally by free margin
It calculates the size of the position in proportion to the free margin of your and your investor's accounts.

Fixed lot allocation
The platform always opens the positions of the same size on the investor account, no matter the size of the positions opened on your account.

Ratio allocation
You can use a multiplier to open positions on the investor account.

Proportionally by equity × multiplier
The size of the position is calculated based on the total equity on the investor account, including profit and loss × multiplier.

Proportionally by balance × multiplier
If you want the investor account to grow in proportion to the growth of your account × multiplier.

FLEXIBLE PRICING PLANS FOR INVESTORS WITH DIFFERENT DEPOSITS

Within a single investment proposal you can offer several pricing plans depending on the minimum deposit.

In your investment proposal you set the minimum investment amount, the type and size of the fee, the recommended investment period and the payment period. These conditions may vary based on the minimum deposit of your investors.


AUTOMATED CALCULATION AND SETTLEMENT OF FEES
The platform automatically calculates the amount of money you should receive. No matter how many investors or investment proposals you have. On the payment date the fees will be automatically transferred to your account from investor accounts.

In the payment report you can see the fee breakdown by investor: the date and the sum. Your investors can view all their payments in their own reports.


Types of fees
You set the periodicity of payments: once a month, a quarter or a year

Performance fee
A percentage of the profit you generated for investors. The fee is calculated based on HwM. The platform automatically recalculates HwM upon deposits and withdrawals made by your investors.

Management fee
A percentage of investors' equity paid regardless of the performance of your strategy. The platform automatically calculates the yearly fee, no matter the length of the set billing period.

Subscription fee
A fixed sum that investors regularly pay for the subscription to your investment proposal regardless of the performance of your strategy.


SEPARATE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR YOU AND YOUR INVESTORS
You and your investors can set profit and loss limits independently from each other.

One one hand, it lets you strictly follow your trading strategy. On the other hand, it lets the investor feel secure as he has full control over his funds.


FLEXIBLE REMUNERATIONS FOR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS AND INTRODUCING PARTNERS*
The platform automatically calculates remunerations that should be paid out to your team members or your partners. Each of them can see their earnings in real time. It helps you avoid conflict situations.

Remunerations are very flexible. You set the size of the remuneration as well as the trading strategies and types of fees it will be deducted from. The platform calculates the sums automatically but you’ll have to make the actual payments manually.


FULL ACCOUNT CONTROL FOR YOUR INVESTORS
Your investors log in to your platform in order to access their trading account. They can open a new account, close an existing one, deposit or withdraw funds, change risk management rules, view account statements and trade analytics. It’s everything they need to feel secure.

None of the investors' actions will in any way interrupt your trading strategy. If investors deposit or withdraw funds, the platform will automatically recalculate their fees. If investors close their accounts, the platform will automatically close all the positions and transfer the remaining funds to their wallets, transferring the fees to your wallet.


INVESTOR ACCOUNTS IN THEIR PREFERRED CURRENCIES
Investors can open accounts nominated in any currency they want. If it differs from the currency on your account, it won’t affect the trading strategy or its performance.


SUBSCRIPTION TO SEVERAL INVESTMENT
PROPOSAL WITH A SINGLE ACCOUNT
If you have several investment proposals, your investors can subscribe to them using a single account. Thus, they can build up an investment portfolio setting individual risk management rules for each proposal.


FLEXIBLE RE-BALANCING OF FUNDS BETWEEN SEVERAL INVESTMENT PROPOSALS

Funds re-balancing enables investors to adapt to the changing market situation by adding more funds to more profitable proposals and withdrawing them from the less profitable ones.

Investors can re-balance the designated funds between the proposals, setting fixed sums for each proposal or just a percentage. After the re-balancing, the trading will be executed in new proportions.


Flawless operation of trading robots
The platform doesn't interrupt the algorithms of your trading robots, when investors subscribe to or unsubscribe from your investment proposal.

Obligatory compliance test for investors
When investors connect to your investment proposal for the first time, they must pass the compliance test. Later they must do it annually. It guarantees that they understand all the risks connected to trading.
