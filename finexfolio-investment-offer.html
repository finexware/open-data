INVESTMENT PROPOSALS


Investment proposals based on your trading history
The platform creates investment proposals according to a single template. It’s designed to facilitate the decision-making process for your investors.

Key decision-making information for your investors
After you’ve uploaded your trading history, the platform will automatically calculate all the key figures that matter for investors and display them on the proposal.

The layout of the investment proposal is standardised, however you can customise certain parts like the description of your trading strategy or the pricing policy.
